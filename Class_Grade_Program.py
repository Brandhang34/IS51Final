STRUCTURED ENGLISH

The program will display the number of grades, the average grade, and the percentage of grades
that are above the average grade. Final.txt will supply the inputs, "grades" in order to do the
following operations. To count the number of grades, the program will append all of the data into a list
and print out the amount of items in the list. In order to find the average grade, the programm will 
add all of the numbers in "Final.txt" and divide by the amount of numbers in the text. The program will 
print that number and display the average. Finally, to print the percentage of grades above average,
the program will go through the list and append those numbers into a new list which are the values above 
average calculated before. Divide the length of the grades above average list by the overall list and 
multiply that value by 100 to get the percentage.
